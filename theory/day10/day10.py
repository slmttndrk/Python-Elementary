# Dictionaries;

# Dictionaries are sometimes found in other languages as “associative
# memories” or “associative arrays”. Unlike sequences, which are indexed by
# a range of numbers, dictionaries are indexed by keys, which can be any
# immutable type; strings and numbers can always be keys. Tuples can be used
# as keys if they contain only strings, numbers, or tuples; if a tuple
# contains any mutable object either directly or indirectly, it cannot be
# used as a key. You can’t use lists as keys, since lists can be modified
# in place using index assignments, slice assignments, or methods like
# append() and extend().

# It is best to think of a dictionary as a set of key: value pairs, with the
# requirement that the keys are unique (within one dictionary). A pair of
# braces creates an empty dictionary: {}. Placing a comma-separated list of
# key:value pairs within the braces adds initial key:value pairs to the
# dictionary; this is also the way dictionaries are written on output.

# The main operations on a dictionary are storing a value with some key and
# extracting the value given the key. It is also possible to delete a
# key:value pair with del. If you store using a key that is already in use,
# the old value associated with that key is forgotten. It is an error to
# extract a value using a non-existent key.

# Performing list(d) on a dictionary returns a list of all the keys used in
# the dictionary, in insertion order (if you want it sorted, just use
# sorted(d) instead). To check whether a single key is in the dictionary,
# use the in keyword.

# arbitrary key and value expressions

# Looping Techniques;

# When looping through dictionaries, the key and corresponding value can be
# retrieved at the same time using the items() method.

# When looping through a sequence, the position index and corresponding value
# can be retrieved at the same time using the enumerate() function.
